# ShinyAppExample

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ShinyAppExample is to demonstrate that shinyapp can be packaged in R Package.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ShinyAppExample from <!--[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
using devtools::install_github() to install it.

``` r
install.packages("ShinyAppExample")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ShinyAppExample)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r apprun}
# run_app()
```

<!--You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.-->
